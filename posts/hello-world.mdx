Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

## Introduction

This blog is here to document my journey of learning computer science and programming in general, explaining technical difficulties and problems I encountered, and how I solved them.

The idea is that I will share my knowledge with you (readers), and hopefully help you to learn too.

Keep in mind that I will not translate the posts in French, all the posts will be written in English, as I'm not a native English speaker, I will probably make mistakes, feel free to open PRs on GitHub to correct them. ðŸ˜Š

I don't plan to publish new posts regularly, but I will do so when I have something new to share.

To stay informed of new blog post, feel free to follow me on Twitter: [@Divlo_FR](https://twitter.com/Divlo_FR).

## How this blog is made

In this section, I will explain what technologies I used to make this blog, and how I used them so that you can build something similar for yourself if you would like to.

The code of this website is open source on GitHub, so you can see the code and contribute to it.
