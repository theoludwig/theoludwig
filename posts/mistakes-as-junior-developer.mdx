Hello! üëã

I will explain some of my mistakes I made as a junior developer, so you can avoid doing them.

## 1. Skipped learning how to do automated tests

Probably one of the most common error junior developers do.

When you begin in programming, you learn a programming language, so you learn variables, conditions, loops, functions, etc.

With these concepts, you might start a new project, thinking that you will be able to do everything.

But as the project grows, you will end up using functions at multiple places in code, so if you change the behavior of a function, it will affect the whole project.

And because the code grows, you might do some refactoring, but because we are humans, we make mistakes, you could accidentally break the whole project even with a tiny change you thought was safe to do.

If you would have automated tests, you would have a way to know if you made a mistake even before deploying to production.

Depending on the programming language you are using, and what is the project you are working on, writing tests will be different.

Be aware that there are 3 main testing strategy:

- [Unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)
- [Integration testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing)
- [End-to-end testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_testing)

After you learnt the basic of programming, learn how to write automated tests, it will save you a lot of time and debugging.

## 2. Thinking too big, with too much abstraction

Abstraction is great, but it can be harder to understand what is going on if actally don't need this abstraction.

Find the right balance, between abstraction and implementation, start simple, and then gradually improve and add more features.

When you start a new project, you should focus on the core of the project, not on the details, to release as soon as possible, a working usable version of your project also called a [**Minimum Viable Product** (MVP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product).

## 3. Focusing on the thing that don't add value to a project
