Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

## Introduction

This blog is here to document my journey of learning computer science, explaining technical difficulties and problems I encountered, and how I solved them.

The idea is that I will share my knowledge with you (readers), and hopefully help you to learn too.

Keep in mind that I will not translate the posts in French, all the posts will be written in English, as I'm not a native English speaker, I will probably make mistakes, feel free to open pull requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/Divlo/Divlo) to correct them. ðŸ˜Š

I don't plan to publish new posts regularly, but I will do so when I have something new to share.

To stay informed of new blog post and to ask questions, feel free to follow me on Twitter: [@Divlo_FR](https://twitter.com/Divlo_FR).

## How this blog is made

In this section, I will explain what technologies I used to make this blog, and what are the technical choices I had to do.

The code of this website is open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/Divlo/Divlo), so you can see the code and contribute to it.

I decided to keep things simple, here are the 2 main features missing on my blog:

- Comments (you can interact with me on my Twitter account)
- Views counter

That not mean that theses features will never be implemented, but to avoid the need of a database now, I dropped out theses features.

### Technologies

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

  It allows to have a server-side rendered website, that means that it is faster and easier to have a good SEO (Search Engine Optimization) than a SPA (Single Page Application).

- [MDX](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler)

  MDX is an extension of Markdown that allows you to use custom React components.

  Here's what Markdown looks like:

  ```md
  A simple paragraph, with some **bold** text and some `inline code`.
  ```

  When using Markdown in a web application, there's a "compile" step; the Markdown needs to be transformed into HTML, so that it can be understood by the browser. Those asterisks get turned into a `<strong>` tag, and each paragraph gets a `<p>` tag etc.

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

  Tailwind is a CSS framework to rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving HTML.
